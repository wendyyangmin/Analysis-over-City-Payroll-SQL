    "We get our dataset from the website https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/City-Employee-Payroll/pazn-qyym through the website provided by professor http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org.  Our dataset records all Los Angeles City employees’ payrolls from 2013 to 2018. The original dataset contains 370k records and 35 columns. It has a good mix of quantitative and qualitative variable for us to analyze.  We are specifically interested in this dataset because it includes quarterly payment and has a good deviation of columns such as base pay, permanent bonus pay, and overtime pay that we can build an analysis on how these extra payments affect the total payment, and if we can draw a job type characteristics from this analysis. The year column would also allow us to make a timeline analysis, so this dataset provides a good amount of information and large enough data for us to analyze from several perspectives. "

We come up with two focuses, first, we want to explore the relationship between payment and year, payment and department, and payment and job title. From there, we can break down to a specific department and if there is a unique pattern of payment for a certain department. The other focus is we are interested in finding if there is a seasonality pattern in the quarterly payment. Since most of the departments are service-based, such as Fire department and Police department, we are specifically interested in seeing if there is a difference in their payment from different quarters. \n",

    "2.    What are the departments with the highest average total payment and if there is something in common through these departments? The most common city employees we know for daily are fireman and policeman, since they are service-based job, we think they probably have higher payments.\n",
    "3.    We know that total payment is generated from base pay, overtime pay, permanent bonus pay, etc., we want to see if these bonus pays will make a difference in total pay?\n",
    "4.    We predict that job title has an impact on salary, as people with higher positions will have a higher pay, but is there a big difference between different departments? We would want to make a comparison here.\n",
    "5.    Our dataset also contains employment type, we should get a conclusion that full-time gets to pay most, but we probably would find some interesting thing if we categorize each employment type and the group of departments appears to have the highest pay might be different.\n",

    "For our second focus, we want to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1.    We want to see if there is a difference in quarterly payment. We predict that for different department, there is a different pattern due to the department characteristics. \n",
    "2.    Second, for different positions in some specific department, we wonder if there is also a pattern over how employees are rewarded through the years in different quarters. We predict that in different quarters of the year, there exists some variation in the pattern due to the seasonality and the feature of a specific department.\n",
    "3.    Third, if we find out some seasonal difference after the previous step, we would like to explore further into the reason behind and find out how the variation differs among various positions in the same department and how large the variation is. \n"

We assume that the null value comes from statistical reasons. One possible explanation is those people simply get paid by year instead of by hour or event. Therefore, it is reasonable fore them to have blank rate here in this column. As for the other four columns, there may exist no over base or over time pay here within the dataset and leads to the nulls. Initially, we prefer to replace with some negative values in order to distinguish those missing values with other normal values we have. When we take a deeper look into our dataset, however, we can see there appears to have some negative values in some of the columns. The insertion of negative values will disturb the current distribution and make the picture no longer a reflection of the real situation.

Combined with our former analysis that the component of payment in fire department is basically half the base-pay and half the overtime payment.

In another words, it denotes that with the temperature goes higher, more fire-related incidents occur and correspondingly, more response from the fire department.\n",

Employees in Water and Power department have the highest average payment in the first quarter. It makes sense when we consider the local weather situation. Los Angeles has an extremely large volume of rain falls on January and February, which will inevitably lead to increase in water and power related incidents and thus employees get more subsidy. Besides, as we research into the source of fund into DWP, we find that the operations of this department are financed solely by the sale of water and electric services. Therefore, the more freezing the weather, the more usage on water and power resources by residents and business and more sales to the department. With a higher sale, the payment to employees would increase accordingly."

    "From the figure above, we can see there is a distinctive and clear hierarchy of payment in the police department. In general, people with higher title, get a higher pay. For example, commanders are rewarded with the highest payment and the volume of payment follows a steady decline with Lieutenant, Sergeant and Supervisor in sequence. The payment within these job titles all reaches top in the third quarter.\n",

    "With such an interesting finding, we try to propose the following possible reasons. First, the Police Department may receive more fund in the third quarter. With more fund, the department would be able to reward its employees with higher payment. Second, another possible reasons may lie in that the third quarter is a travel season. Therefore, a lot more people come to Los Angeles. With a denser population, the crime rate correspondingly rises. Therefore, having to deal with more cases, the police department have more payment as reward."

This kind of emergency in return makes those mechanic welcomes a higher payment in the first quarter."

    "3.    We know that total payment is generated from base pay, overtime pay, permanent bonus pay, etc., we want to see if these bonus pays will make a difference in total pay?\n",
    "\n",
    "         *A: we find that Public Accountability's base pay is significantly higher than other departments, which agreed with our previous observation that Public Accountability ranks top 1 for total payment. However, Fire department only ranked at 4th, so we figured there should be other reason that makes Fire department’s total payment very high. When we analyze the overtime pay, we surprisingly find that Fire has a significantly higher overtime pay than the other department, almost four times as the 2nd department the water and power. Later, we find that for Fire department, certain position has higher overtime pay than its base pay, and they generally have very high overtime pay than other departments, which make sense why even Fire has a lower base pay, it still has the highest total pay. For the permanent bonus, it has to do more with the job title, the more senior job like Fire Assistant Chief and Executive Director Police Commission has a lot of permanent bonus than entry-level positions. So digging into the constitute part of the total payment, the bonus does make a difference in total pay.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4.    We predict that job title has an impact on salary, as people with higher positions will have a higher pay, but is there a big difference between different departments? We would want to make a comparison here.\n",
    "\n",
    "         *A: We compared Fire, Police, Water and Power, and Public Accountability department. We find that overall, senior levels position like Fire Captain, Police Captain, and Senior Load Dispatcher do have a higher pay, however, there are exceptions. For the Fire department, Fire Helicopter Pilot and Fireboat Pilot have the highest salary, probably because of the techniques required for these types of jobs. Across departments, the Fire department has the highest average payment, while Police and Water and Power department are about the same. We also take a look at Public Accountability since it has the highest total pay, and find that they basically only have a base pay, and it is a lot higher than the others. We searched the duty of this department and found that they served as independent watchdog which means they monitor the performance of DWP department. So we conclude this department is a special case as the employees in this department need to really get paid well to do a good job on monitoring.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5.    Our dataset also contains employment type, we should get a conclusion that full-time gets to pay most, but we probably would find some interesting thing if we categorize each employment type and the group of departments appears to have the highest pay might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "        *A: We indeed find full-time has the highest average payment. For Full-time group, we find half departments are service based such as Fire, Water and Power. The other half are advanced administration department, such as the City Administrative Officer (CAO), City Administrative Officer. For the Part-time group, a lot of these departments are for public facilities, such as Recreation and Parks, library, and transportation. For the Pre-event group, like it is categorized, most of the departments in the rank are seasonal jobs, like Cultural Affairs, pension (LAFPP) and Personnel. Overall, the only department that overlaps in all three employment types is Police, which is reasonable since Police would need more police force for certain period, but they do not always need a lot full-time police.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second focus, we want to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1.    We want to see if there is a difference in quarterly payment. We predict that for different department, there is a different pattern due to the department characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "        *A: we find out in our targeted four departments, payments in fire, police and public accountability all peak at the third quarter and for water and power department, it reaches its highest in the first quarter. Both Police and Fire have a steady increase for the first three quarters. While for the Water and Power department, it has the highest average payment in the first quarter. And we find a reasonable causation for this is the operations of this department are financed solely by the sale of water and electric services. So more usage of energy and water in cold season will reflect on a higher quarter salary.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.    Second, for different positions in some specific department, we wonder if there is also a pattern over how employees are rewarded through the years in different quarters. We predict that in different quarters of the year, there exists some variation in the pattern due to the seasonality and the feature of a specific department.\n",
    "\n",
    "        *A: as we probe deeper into the fire, police and water and power department, we find out that in different departments, the payment pattern associated with quarter and position varies. In police department, there is a clear hierarchy over quarter payment. With higher title, the payment gets higher. In fire department, firefighters get the most payment instead of positions like supervisors. Besides, in Los Angeles Water and Power department(LAWPD),the mechanic ranks top when considering its quarter payment and followed by analysts. This pattern denotes that those two positions take up dominant positions in LAPWD. Possible explanation could be that the works in LAPWD is conducted mainly by those two types of workers. For mechanics, they are mainly responsible for conducting the detailed construction work and solving technical problems. For analyst, they will discover the systematical pattern and aim to raise the overall performance of the department. In another words, the mechanics emphasize front-end works and for analysts, they emphasizes on back-end works, and they altogether occupy a significant position inside the department.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.    Third, if we find out some seasonal difference after the previous step, we would like to explore further into the reason behind and find out how the variation differs among various positions in the same department and how large the variation is. \n",
    "\n",
    "        *A: Especially, in the fire department, the firefighters not only have the highest payment in total but also display a seasonal pattern across quarters. The quarter payment for firefighters rises with the temperature. The higher the temperature in that quarter, the more payment towards firefighters. Therefore, we propose a possible explanation for that with higher temperature in Los Angeles, more fire-related incidents may happen and correspondingly calls for more worktime from firefighters. Besides, because of the special location of Los Angeles, there may be more forest fires in summer which also add firefighters' workload. Then as for the Water and Power department, we can see that the payment for mechanics reach its peak in the first quarter which could be partially due to higher rainfalls in the first quarters. Heavy rainfalls would threat the water pipes and also the electrical facilities in the city and, as a result, will lead to more repairing work for the mechanics.*\n",

    "When thinking of the reasons behind, we consider that the way of how fire incidents are count may be taken into account. For example, both forest fire and fire alarm will be counted once into the incidence report. However, obviously, those two different type of fire incident have comparably distinctive impact. In order to put off a forest fire, more firefighters have to take part in and meanwhile a lot more resources are consumed.Inevitably, it will cause more over-time payment for the fire department than the incident caused by a false fire alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a deeper look into the situation, we can see two incident types display different patterns. First, for ems incident, there is not a clear seasonality over the years which denotes that the cooperation between fire department and other government department remains relatively constant over the months. Second, for non-ems situation, which reflects about real fire-related situations displays a month-based fluctuations. Non-EMS situations peak at December and January and remain roughly the average in all the other months. The rule revealed from this picture also goes against our original assumption.\n",
